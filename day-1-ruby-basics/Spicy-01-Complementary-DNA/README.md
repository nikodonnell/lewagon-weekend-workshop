Original idea: [Complementary DNA on Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/kata/complementary-dna)

Change to the working directory of the assignment, run the test and open it up in Sublime:

```bash
  cd ~/code/lewagon-weekend-workshop/day-1-ruby-basics/Spicy-01-Complementary-DNA
  rake
  stt
```

## Instructions:

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G".
Write a method `complementary_dna` which takes a DNA string and return the complement.
